  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am a dedicated and intelligent Software Engineer with a strong background in Computer Science, holding a Bachelor’s degree (Second Class Upper Division). With over two years of hands-on experience in software development and ICT support, I’ve developed a solid foundation in building scalable, maintainable, and user-centric applications — especially in Android environments and web-based systems.

My expertise spans the full Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), Agile methodologies, and a deep commitment to delivering high-quality, production-ready solutions. I thrive in environments that demand focus, discipline, and self-direction, and I consistently meet deadlines while ensuring that the work I produce is clean, efficient, and impactful.

Beyond my technical skills, I am deeply committed to continuous learning and growth — not just for myself, but also in uplifting and supporting those around me. Time management, clear communication, and professionalism are values I live by in both team and individual settings.

I bring not only skill but also integrity, discipline, and a strong sense of purpose to every project I take on.
